# Failure Dialog for Flightgear

## Install for Flightgear 2016.1/2016.2:

Copy all the files, except README.md and LICENSE, into your Flightgear installation under the folder data ($FGDATA).

## Install for Flightgear 3.4

Copy the Nasal folder, into your Flightgear installation under the folder data ($FGDATA).
The go back in my commit history and notice the commit "Modifications to some FG files nessesary to show the new Dialog from the menu.", do those modifications to the 3 files in your FG 3.4.

## Use:

When running Flightgear, go into menu - equipment - failure dialog.
Enjoy!

## How do I see all the features that it can do:

Try the plane JA37, it has a bunch of custom failures.
